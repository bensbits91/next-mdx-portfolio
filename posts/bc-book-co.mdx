Worked with esteemed Professors Emeritus at Claremont Graduate University to build a new version of their popular textbook. I helped rethink the instructional approach and rework examples, helping to make the book more effective and easier to understand. I also selected and solved equations, and wrote and edited content. I learned to use LaTeX to typeset pages of the book. Within months, I was the lead typesetter in charge of layout. I helped train other typesetters. This role uncovered my love for using software to develop a user experience, spawning a long career in software, with an emphasis on user perspective and user experience.
